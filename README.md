# OpenDeck Ajazz N1 Plugin

**Fork of [opendeck-ajazz-n1](https://github.com/4ndv/opendeck-ajazz-n1)**

An unofficial plugin for Ajazz N1 devices. This fork provides dedicated support for the Ajazz N1 only.

## OpenDeck version

Requires OpenDeck 2.5.0 or newer

## Supported devices

- Ajazz N1 (0300:3007)

## Platform support

- Linux: Guaranteed, if stuff breaks - I'll probably catch it before public release
- Mac: Best effort, no tests before release, things may break, but I probably have means to fix them
- Windows: Zero effort, no tests before release, if stuff breaks - too bad, it's up to you to contribute fixes

## Installation

1. Download an archive from [releases](https://github.com/4ndv/opendeck-ajazz-n1/releases)
2. In OpenDeck: Plugins -> Install from file
3. Linux: Download [udev rules](./40-opendeck-ajazz-n1.rules) and install them by copying into `/etc/udev/rules.d/` and running `sudo udevadm control --reload-rules`
4. Unplug and plug again the device, restart OpenDeck

## Building
